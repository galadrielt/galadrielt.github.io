            <p>I wish I could just download everything I ever wanted to know, like how to code, directly into my brain. But I’m not Neo and this is not the Matrix and that’s of course not possible, yet. I like to think that most things are possible
              given enough time and knowledge, but until direct knowledge download is available there is self-learning...

                The first thing that I noticed when I looked straight at it instead of giving it all the side-eye was how it made my brain actually feel. It lit me up like I haven’t been since I was a kid in science class. The second thing I noticed
                was that it energizes me! I always thought programming all day would turn my brains into mushrooms and marshmallows and twist my body into the shape of the letter C. I was so so wrong...

                <p>Then I started to hear other things. Things like, to be a good programmer you had to sell your life and soul to the time lords. That to be a good programmer you had to program twenty-four hours a day everyday. That to be a good
                  programmer you had to write code that would create more time in which you could then use to write more code. I panicked a little inside...<br />

                  <p>I think all of this sounds fantastic. It makes sense and I can understand the importance of what this kind of version control has done for developers. I even understand the basic theory behind it but I am finding it hard to learn
                    how to use! I have used it five times recently to try and push my personal website through Git into Github and have caused my personal website project to burn villages down exactly those five times...</p>
